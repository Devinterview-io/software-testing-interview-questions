What is the difference between load and stress testing?</h2></div> <div><h3>Answer:</h3> <div class="answer"><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><p>A <strong>load test</strong> is usually conducted to understand the behaviour of the system under a specific expected load. This load can be the <em>expected concurrent number of users</em> on the application performing a specific number of transactions within the set duration. This test will give out the response times of all the important business critical transactions.</p><p>A <strong>stress testing</strong> instead is performed to understand the upper limits of capacity within the system. This kind of test is done to determine the system's robustness in terms of <em>extreme load</em> and helps application administrators to determine if the system will perform sufficiently if the current load goes well above the expected maximum.</p></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_performance_testing#Load_testing" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="What is the difference between load and stress testing?

How would you unit test private methods?</h2></div> <div><h3>Answer:</h3> <div class="answer"><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><p>If you want to unit test a private method, something may be wrong. Unit tests are (generally speaking) meant to test the interface of a class, meaning its public (and protected) methods. You can of course "hack" a solution to this (even if just by making the methods public), but you may also want to consider:</p><ol><li>If the method you'd like to test is really worth testing, it may be worth to move it into its own class.</li><li>Add more tests to the public methods that call the private method, testing the private method's functionality. (As the commentators indicated, you should only do this if these private methods's functionality is really a part in with the public interface. If they actually perform functions that are hidden from the user (i.e. the unit test), this is probably bad).</li></ol></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/250692/how-do-you-unit-test-private-methods" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="How would you unit test private methods?

This should have a very narrow and well defined scope. Complex dependencies and interactions to the outside world are <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">stubbed or mocked</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Integration test</strong>: Test the correct inter-operation of multiple subsystems. There is whole spectrum there, from testing integration between two classes, to testing integration with the production environment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Smoke test (aka Sanity check)</strong>: A simple integration test where we just check that when the system under test is invoked it returns normally and does not blow up.  </p><ul><li>Smoke testing is both an analogy with electronics, where the first test occurs when powering up a circuit (if it smokes, it's bad!)...</li><li>... and, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/520064/what-is-unit-test-integration-test-smoke-test-regression-test#comment13627138_520116">apparently</a>, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_testing_(mechanical)">plumbing</a>, where a system of pipes is literally filled by smoke and then checked visually. If anything smokes, the system is leaky.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Regression test</strong>: A test that was written when a bug was fixed. It ensures that this specific bug will not occur again. The full name is "non-regression test". It can also be a test made prior to changing an application to make sure the application provides the same outcome.</p></li></ul><p>To this, I will add:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Acceptance test</strong>: Test that a feature or use case is correctly implemented. It is similar to an integration test, but with a focus on the use case to provide rather than on the components involved.</p></li><li><p><strong>System test</strong>: Tests a system as a black box. Dependencies on other systems are often mocked or stubbed during the test (otherwise it would be more of an integration test).</p></li><li><p><strong>Pre-flight check</strong>: Tests that are repeated in a production-like environment, to alleviate the 'builds on my machine' syndrome. Often this is realized by doing an acceptance or smoke test in a production like environment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Canary test</strong> is an automated, non-destructive test that is <strong>run on a regular basis</strong> in a <strong>LIVE</strong> environment, such that if it ever fails, something really bad has happened. 
Examples might be:</p><ul><li>Has data that should only ever be available in DEV/TEST appeared in

Is Unit Testing worth the effort?</h2></div> <div><h3>Answer:</h3> <div class="answer"><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><ul><li>Unit Tests allows you to make big changes to code quickly. You know it works now because you've run the tests, when you make the changes you need to make, you need to get the tests working again. This saves hours.</li><li>TDD helps you to realise when to stop coding. Your tests give you confidence that you've done enough for now and can stop tweaking and move on to the next thing.</li><li>The tests and the code work together to achieve better code. Your code could be bad / buggy. Your TEST could be bad / buggy. In TDD you are banking on the chances of both being bad / buggy being low. Often it's the test that needs fixing but that's still a good outcome.</li><li>TDD helps with coding constipation. When faced with a large and daunting piece of work ahead writing the tests will get you moving quickly.</li><li>Unit Tests help you really understand the design of the code you are working on. Instead of writing code to do something, you are starting by outlining all the conditions you are subjecting the code to and what outputs you'd expect from that.</li><li>Unit Tests give you instant visual feedback, we all like the feeling of all those green lights when we've done. It's very satisfying. It's also much easier to pick up where you left off after an interruption because you can see where you got to - that next red light that needs fixing.</li><li>Contrary to popular belief unit testing does not mean writing twice as much code, or coding slower. It's faster and more robust than coding without tests once you've got the hang of it. Test code itself is usually relatively trivial and doesn't add a big overhead to what you're doing. This is one you'll only believe when you're doing it :)</li><li>I think it was Fowler who said: "Imperfect tests, run frequently, are much better than perfect tests that are never written at all". I interpret this as giving me permission to write tests where I think they'll be most useful even if the rest of my code coverage is woefully incomplete.</li><li>Good unit tests can help document and define what something is supposed to do</li><li>Unit tests help with code re-use. Migrate both your code and your tests to your new project. Tweak the code till the tests run again.</li></ul></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67299/is-unit-testing-worth-the-effort" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Is Unit Testing worth the effort?

How do I test a private function or a class that has private methods, fields or inner classes?</h2></div> <div><h3>Answer:</h3> <div class="answer"><div><div><div class="AnswerBody"><p>The best way to test a private method is via another public method. If this cannot be done, then one of the following conditions is true:</p><ol><li>The private method is dead code</li><li>There is a design smell near the class that you are testing</li><li>The method that you are trying to test should not be private</li></ol><p>Also, by testing private methods you are testing the implementation. This defeats the purpose of unit testing, which is to test the inputs/outputs of a class' contract. A test should only know enough about the implementation to mock the methods it calls on its dependencies. Nothing more. If you can not change your implementation without having to change a test - chances are that your test strategy is poor.</p></div></div><div class="row my-2"><div><span><i>Source:</i>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34571/how-do-i-test-a-private-function-or-a-class-that-has-private-methods-fields-or" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="How do I test a private function or a class that has private methods, fields or inner classes?
